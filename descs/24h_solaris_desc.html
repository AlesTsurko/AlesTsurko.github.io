<span class="multi-comment"> To increasingly rapid acceleration of cinema you can
    respond only by its slowing. The installation actualizes concepts of time and space
    in the Tarkovsky's Solaris. It’s a possibility to dive into the film experience
    as a sufficient and finished audiovisual world at the moment of estrangement from a
    cinematic narrative.

    <p>Through digital hyperbolization of time and space to 24 hours the sound effect of each
        pixel that finds a combination with a soundtrack is achieved.</p>

    <p>There are two videos on two screens. The first video starts from zoom-in and scaled
        through zoom-out, and the second one has a reverse action. This effect allows the
        audience to dive into picture, to become a part of it, to become a place where
        Tarkovsky’s cinematic images are connected.</p>

    <p>The idea of the sound is in immersion to each frame.</p>

    <p>The immersion occurs to the pixel level, the quantum of digital image. As well as in the
        original soundtrack that Eduard Artemyev has wrote on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANS_synthesizer" target="_blank">ANS</a>, there
        is a transformation of visible into audible in the 24h Solaris. But here is a different
        technique - the sonification of main colors of the each frame. The interaction of colors
      becomes not only a harmony technique, but also the rhythm, dynamic and articulation.
      The Solaris itself becomes a musical form.</p>

    <p>The average color tone used as well as the pixels separately. The tone is transitions
        between frames and dynamic of action. Harmony also appears at a deeper level: the pixel
        color is a mixture of red, green and blue, each of which corresponds to its own timbre.</p>

    <p>The original soundtrack as material for sound wave synthesis. This is done to reflect dynamic
      of the Solaris’ sound and for getting a deeper texture.</p>

    <p>A program that is written in Processing slows down the film to 12% as well as in the
        projections. Then it analyze the result. Each frame split symmetrically by 24 points:
        8 horizontal and 3 vertical. The color value of each point transferred via OSC to
        SuperCollider.</p>

<!--     <p>Below are the same frames.</p> -->

    <p>The program sends data with intervals. It’s like a screenshot every 4 seconds. The length
        of the interval defines a tempo and the texture richness.</p>

    <p>8-bit digital color has a range from 0 to 255. For the red, for example, the range have mapped
        to 0-17 that corresponds to 6 notes of the pitch set in three octaves.</p>

    <p>The average value is the mood of the frame. For this reason the range of this value also mapped
        to pitch set. The pitch is added to the pixels stream and defines the tonic, scale and
        mood. The pitch set has composed to make changes in the music mood, when the mood of image
        changes.</p>

    <p>The color ranges also mapped to dynamic, articulation and rhythm. And as the main mood at
        the moment, the average value is a multiplier of parameters.</p>

    <p>A rhythm figure of some phrases programmed to fit 4 seconds. But other doesn’t get new data
        while phrase is playing. This shadows result to smooth form and quit flow.</p>

    <p>Texture includes seven instruments: a texture red, green, blue; a percussion red, green,
        blue; a “lead” that synthesized from the original soundtrack.</p>

    <p>The lead plays the average value of a RGB sum.</p>

    <p>The program works in real time.</p>
